- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @amfouda
- I'm a security researcher with 17 years experience in reverse engineering and the analysis of malicious and unwanted software. 
- I've written many tools using (basic) python that i've used internally for my research tasks, but am now looking to advance my python coding skills by creating more intermediate and advanced level analysis tools, as well as any other project that comes to mind. 
- Feel free to reach me on amirfouda@gmail.com
